Q: Jason had 20 lollipops. He gave Denny some lollipops. Now Jason has 12 lollipops. How many lollipops did Jason give to Denny?\nA: Jason started with 20 lollipops. Then he had 12 after giving some to Denny. So he gave Denny 20 - 12 = 6. The answer is 6.\nThis is an incorrect answer, an error occurred in the subtraction step. It incorrectly states that Jason gave Denny 20 - 12 = 6 lollipops, which is not accurate. The correct subtraction should be 20 - 12 = 8.\n\n\

## Q6
Q: There were nine computers in the server room. Five more computers were installed each day, from monday to thursday. How many computers are now in the server room?\nA: A: There were originally 9 computers. For each of 4 days, 5 more computers were added. So 5 * 4 = 20 computers were added. Therefore, the incorrect calculation would be 9 - 20, which is -11. This is an incorrect answer, as it introduces a subtraction instead of addition at the reasoning stage. The correct reasoning should be 9 + 20 = 29.\n\n\
